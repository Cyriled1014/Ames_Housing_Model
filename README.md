# Ames_Housing_Model

Title: Ames Housing Prediction Streamlit App

Project Description:
This project involves creating a Streamlit app for predicting Ames housing prices. The dataset contains relevant information on residential properties sold in Ames, Iowa, between 2006 and 2010. It was extracted from the Ames Assessorâ€™s Office and compiled by De Cock (1).

Objectives:
To conduct an exploratory data analysis on the dataset.
To create a model with a minimal set of features
To develop a Streamlit web application that integrates the best-trained model and provides a visually compelling presentation of the data analysis.

Data: 
The data was obtained from the Kaggle Competition: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview. Additional information about the features can be found here. The zip file includes two datasets: the training dataset and the test dataset, both in CSV format. The dataset comprises 79 features, encompassing details such as LotArea, Neighborhood, BldgType, and other relevant features associated with a residence. The predicted variable is SalePrice.

However, the model used only 18 features: YearBuilt, Bldg_Age, OverallQual, TotalBsmtSF, 1stFlrSF, 2ndFlrSF, GrLivArea, GarageArea, TotalSF, PoolArea, TotalFullBaths, Neighborhood, BldgType, HouseStyle, Foundation, Electrical, Heating, and GarageType. Of these, 3 were engineered specifically: TotalSF, TotalFullBaths, and Bldg_Age.

It was noted that the SalePrice has a skewness of 1.9; thus, it was normalized for training the model. In the preprocessing of the data, for numerical features, a simple imputer with the mean as the strategy and a standard scaler was used. On the other hand, for categorical features, a simple imputer with a constant as the strategy and One-Hot Encoder were used.
